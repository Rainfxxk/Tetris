# Tetris

a simple tetris written in C and SDL2.

My first course design during my undergraduate years was to implement a Tetris game. Now that I have graduated and am currently learning SDL2, I decided to write a Tetris game again as a way to practice. This code serves as a memento of my undergraduate days.

make sure you have the SDL2 environment installed. Then run `make`, enjoy the game!
